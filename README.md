# ChessOpeningGuide

 ### [YouTube Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/G5KvoW0oyDo)

<h2>Description</h2>
This is my first major java project meant for a school assignment. I was tasked with creating a program/tool that would help a client of mine with a certain task. My client was interested in playing chess so I decided to help make a simple program designed to help my client get started with the basics of the game. It is focused on using a GUI system to navigate between many different options and features. (Note: the full program could not be uploaded due to a recovery error, however most of the code is presented)
